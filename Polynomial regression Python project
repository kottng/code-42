In this Python code, we implement a polynomial regression model using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to predict the cost of a flat in a city. The code loads training and testing data from text files, where the input data represents the size of the flat in square feet and the output data represents the cost of the flat in thousands of dollars. Then, it defines a class called 'PolynomialRegression' that can fit a polynomial regression model of a specified degree to the input data and make predictions on new data. The 'print_polynomial' method prints the polynomial regression equation, and the 'plot' function generates a plot of the testing data and predicted values.
