Assignment Variant <sup>1</sup>
Equations of Curves:.

<var>f</var><sub>1</sub> = 0.35*(<var>x</var> ^ 2) - 0.95 * (<var>x</var>) + 2.7),
<var>f</var><sub>2</sub> = 3<var>x</var> + 1,
<var>f</var><sub>3</sub> = 1 / (<var>x</var> + 2).
Approximate Solution Method of Equations: Combined Method (Chords and Tangents).

Quadrature Formulas: Simpson's Formula (Parabolic).
