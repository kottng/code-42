This repository contains code implements a program that calculates the sum of squares of elements in an array of integers using assembly language.

The repository includes a **makefile**, a **Clang** program for generating test cases, and an assembly program with the main function that calculates the sum of squares.

The program reads the length of the array and the array itself from the standard input, calculates the sum of squares using assembly instructions, and prints the result to the standard output.

The code is written in **Intel x86-64 assembly language** and is designed to be run on a **Linux** system. The repository includes a sample input file for testing the program.
