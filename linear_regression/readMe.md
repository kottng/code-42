This code performs linear regression on two sets of data, one for training and one for testing. The training data is loaded from a file called 'train.txt' and the testing data is loaded from a file called 'test.txt'. The data is then reshaped so that it can be processed by the linear regression algorithm.

The linear regression algorithm is implemented using a class called LinearRegression, which has two methods: fit and predict. The fit method takes the training data as input and uses it to calculate the coefficients of a linear equation in the form k*x + b. The predict method takes a value of x and uses the coefficients calculated by the fit method to predict the corresponding value of y.

Finally, the code creates an instance of the LinearRegression class, fits the training data to it, and uses it to make predictions for the training data. It then creates a plot of the training data and the predictions.
